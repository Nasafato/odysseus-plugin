# The modulation of desire

Were we born, ready-made, equipped with all which we needed to fulfill what we were meant to be as men and women, the way Athena burst out of Zeus's head, Aegis in hand, armed for battle and the distribution of wisdom to hapless mortals?

In the long gap between then and now, we seem to accumulate a great many things. We learn to love, to argue, and also we learn what to want and about the opinions of others. We seek approval and validation, from ourselves and the world, and we go about life in quenchless thirst. Foolishly, we imagine this thirst to be slaked by whatever fashion we adopt, yet what we find is a never-ending hunger. We are bundles of desires, and every which way we are pulled by them, and sometimes they are powerful and opposite enough  it feels we are being torn down the middle, or they have multiplied without end so we no longer know what to do, and we feel as though we are to pop, like a balloon filled with too much air. In such cases, we descend either into a swamp of lethargy, or we rise to a manic madness which, eventually, sends one reeling into the same place they had started, exhausted.

Mao once said, "Power comes at the end of a bayonet". Then, from where did the bayonet come? Somewhere, a man was convinced that he ought to wield it, in service of some cause, whether that be himself, or his commanding general, or his nation, or something else entirely.

Desire and dreams, I say, woke him up out of bed and pulled him into uniform, stood him behind his platoon and marched him forward into the battle lines. From where, then, do these desires come?

When I was young, I wanted to save the world. In high school, I'd set my plans—I'd study economics so I could solve poverty, and I'd make schools for children and their parents, so the parents would know how to parent, and the children would be taken care of both at school and at home.

Then I got to college, and the shape of that dream changed into something more like the cubicle of an investment banker—then later, it changed once again to the sticker-covered laptop of a billionaire founder. I had my reasons. Poverty seemed expensive to solve, and schools expensive to run, so surely—surely—I must have a lot of money and a lot of power.

I told myself that, and yet, every passing day the words I'd say were spoken a little more quietly. In its place, I would hear instead the growing siren call of something more strident and more alluring. I saw visions of money flowing into my bank account. I imagined my peers saying my name with hushed wonder. I imagined newspaper articles about me. How smart he was, how insightful, how hard-working. Surely, here was a man worthy of respect and love, who we could follow.

And so my dream of saving the world was subsumed by the mere dream of being rich. Some might call that young boy an idealist—but I'd say he had the right idea all along. 

What man does not understand—the water around him—is his desires, but also more than his desires. Man produces change in the world, and it is his desires which propel him. Yet what often he does not know, for he is rather ignorant at first of the many types of forces in the world, is the source of those desires themselves.'

No one was born wanting to become an investment banker or a startup founder. No one was born wanting to be a doctor or a computer scientist. No one was born wanting to love a girl like this or a boy like that. What we have are many kinds of desires—some animal in nature, like our desire for food and sex and companionship. And I daresay the competition for status is innate as well. We as humans often delude ourselves into thinking these desires spring forth from some unknown source, and are of our own choosing. But that would be a lie. We did not choose most of them. We collected them.

Starting from our first moment of consciousness, we learn from the world—not just how to act, but what to want. We see our brother reach for a toy we had ignored, and suddenly we want the same toy. We see our friend arrive to class with a pair of jeans from a shop we'd never heard of, and suddenly we've found the store on our phone and are already scrolling through the catalog. 

Desires, crafted in such a way, give rise to goals whose generation we hardly question. Wisdom is the acquisition of the ability to see through all the way to the roots of ourselves, and then—critically—to change ourselves. We, as humans, have the ability to choose, not just between two things, but two desires, and not just two desires, but two versions of ourselves—and it is at the divergence of those two paths we find all the possibility in the world. 

This, then, is the modulation of desire. We are not just mimetic creatures—we are also creatures of free will. We mold the earth around us and convince it to change shape and color, and yet the greatest project, and the hardest battle, is within ourselves. 

But to what should you change yourselves? The modern world offers many voices, but few real answers. They say you should own a house, or fulfill the American dream, or go to college—but the key word is "they say". Someone said this, and for some reason it became something you ought to have, merely because someone else said it.

Give yourself some more credit.
